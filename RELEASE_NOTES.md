## August 2022 - Release 3.0
*   **ðŸ’£!!New submodule structure!!ðŸ’£** We are making room for more exciting features, so all SAP-related submodules ([SAP_CDC ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cortex-dag-generator), [SAP_REPORTING ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cortex-reporting/), [SAP_ML_MODELS ](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cortex-ml-models)) have been moved under the directory `src/SAP/`. To upgrade, we recommend copying your customized views into the /ecc or /s4 directories respectively in your repository so you can see the changes after pulling this remote and using the difftool of your choice. Merge your changes with the new releases in the submodules first, and commit them into your forks or merging repositories. If getting a conflict, clone the Data Foundation, adjust the `.gitmodules` file manually, remove the directories for the old submodules (`src/SAP_CDC`, `src/views/SAP_REPORTING` and `src/views/SAP_ML_MODELS`) and execute `git modules update --remote`. See the `Recommendations for upgrades` under the `/docs` directory.
*   Submodules now execute completely independently. SAP's ML Models and SAP Reporting submodules now have their own `yaml` file for independent execution.
*   New experimental `UNION` logic! Available if your SAP ECC and S/4 systems do not share the same MANDT (a fix for this is coming soon). All views are now moved to `/ecc` or `/s4` respectively. This alters the templates of all of the views and requires two sets of datasets (e.g.: one `raw landing` for ECC, one for S/4). These datasets can be passed to the deployment in the file `sap_config.env`. See the documentation for more information about the `UNION` feature.
*   SAP Reporting can now be deployed using a configuration file (`sap_config.env`) instead of parameters from the `gcloud builds submit --substitutions` command. Parameters received from the substitutions override configurations in the file to maintain backwards compatibility. This affects all the cloudbuild*.yaml files.
*   New simplified view for Sales Orders (_SalesOrders_V2_) with less underlying joins for use cases that do not require them.
*   New experimental views for a collaboration with [C3.ai](https://c3.ai/). These views are considered `experimental` as we increase the functionality around and on top of them in collaboration with C3.ai. The output of experimental views may be subject to change until they are considered stable. Experimental views are flagged with an `## EXPERIMENTAL` comment.
*   **Turbo mode for SAP Reporting**: The file `sap_config.env` contains a variable called `TURBO`. If set to `true`, the cloudbuild*.yaml file will be generated dynamically from the dependencies file. This reduces the deployment time from ~1h to 7 minutes. We recommend using TURBO = `false` for first deployment to spot differnces in the source tables all in the same run.
*   Candidates for enhancement points within the code, that is portiions where customers should consider incorporating changes or applying extensions, are flagged with a comment `## CORTEX-CUSTOMER`.
*   Templatized currency and language for views that require the values to be hardcoded for better performance. See the documentation on how to configure these values.
*   New non-changing views created as tables by default. Sources that are unlikely to ever change (e.g.: material document types, valuation areas) are now created as tables -instead of views- by default. See the updated Entity-Relationship Diagram to spot them. This behavior will be back-ported to other pre-existing views with a future feature for default materialization.
*   New views: WeatherDaily, SalesOrders_V2, DeliveryBlockingReasonsMD, BillingBlockingReasonsMD, StorageLocationsMD, PurchaseDocumentTypesMD, MovementTypesMD, ReasonForMovementTypesMD, SpecialStocksMD, PurchasingOrganizationsMD, BatchesMD,  MaterialPlantsMD, ProductionOrders, PurchasingGroupsMD, MaterialsValuation, MaterialsMovement, MaterialTypesMD, BillOfMaterialsMD, DivisionsMD, ValuationAreasMD.
*   New DAG for currency conversion and currency decimal shifting. This will be improved to run a smaller range of conversion dates in a future release.
*   When test data is set to true, the dynamically generated MERGE operation will now copy the test data from the raw landing dataset into the CDC dataset. Test data in CDC dataset is no longer copied as it is from the raw landing. Test data is still meant to provide a base for specific demo scenarios and is still not guaranteed to be a reliable source with any quality or referential integrity.
*   We have started marking releases with tags. This release is now [v3.0](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cortex-data-foundation/releases/tag/v3.0)
*   Views for ECC are now matched in S4. See S/4HANA ERD for more information.
*   New guide with [recommendations for upgrades](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cortex-data-foundation/blob/main/docs/upgrade_recommendations/upgrade_recommendations.md) in the `docs` directory.

### Upgrade Recommendations
Since most views have at least a minor change in their dataset jinja templates (i.e., going from `{{ dataset_cdc_processed }}` to `{{ dataset_cdc_processed_ecc }}` ), we recommend the following:
1. If you haven't already, try to identify customizations in your SQLs with a comment so they are visible in the diff.
2. Create a branch for merging as outlined in the recommendations for upgrade for each submodule. Start with the submodules and leave the Data Foundation supermodule for last.
3. In the reporting submodule, copy all the SQLs with `CREATE OR REPLACE` followed by actual SELECT statements for views (e.g., `CustomersMD`) to the folder of your system version (`ecc` or `s4`), **except those that are not already there** (e.g., `ecc/CompaniesMD`). For example, if you have deployed and customized views for ECC, copy all the SQL files into `cortex-reporting/ecc` except for views that already have a .sql file in ecc/. You can use a command like ```cp -n *.sql ./ecc``` for this
4. Merge the changes from the remote branch with the upgrade into the temp branch. Once conflicts are solved, merge the merged branch into the main branch for your submodules.
5. Once you have pushed the merged changes into your repository, the merge process for the submodules in cortex-data-foundation is expected to produce a message like: ```src/views/SAP_REPORTING deleted in github-release3 and modified in HEAD.  Version HEAD of src/views/SAP_REPORTING left in tree.``` . Fix conflicts in the `.gitmodules` file. Valid paths for submodules now start with `src/SAP/`.
6. Add and commit the changes in the `.gitmodules` file.
7. Remove the remaining directories for the previous structure (`src/views/SAP_REPORTING`, `src/views/SAP_ML_MODELS`, `src/SAP_CDC`)




### Known issues
*   Currency conversion DAG processes all available dates each time. This will be addressed in a future release.
*   If the MANDT for the ECC and S/4HANA systems is the same, the UNION mode is not supported. This will be addressed in a future release.
*   Different source Reporting projects for ECC and S/4 in UNION mode are not supported.
*   ML deployment fails wtih a templating error if executed after UNION option from the Data Foundation. This error is avoided if UNION is executed from SAP REPORTING submodule. The error has no effect in the deployment of the reporting views.


## June 2022 - Release 2.2
*   New external datasets available: Holidays, Weather, Trends and product hierarchy flattener to feed the Trends search terms.
*   Region-specific deployments with test data are now possible. Supported locations are: US and EU (multilocations). Supported regions: us-central1, us-west4, us-west2, northamerica-northeast1, northamerica-northeast2, us-east4, us-west1, us-west3, southamerica-east1, southamerica-west1, us-east1, asia-south2, asia-east2, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast2, asia-south1, asia-northeast2, asia-northeast3, asia-southeast1, australia-southeast1, asia-east1, asia-northeast1, europe-west1, europe-north1, europe-west3, europe-west2, europe-west4, europe-central2, europe-west6. More information on supported regions and limitations of regional datasets in BigQuery [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations).
*   Addressing records with the same key and operation flag sent more than once in different chunks into raw landing
*   Escaping of table and column names in DAG and real-time view generation to avoid issues with reserved words ([issue #7](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cortex-data-foundation/issues/7))
*   Minor tweak to CustomersMD: Coalesce address between customer master data and latest record in ADRC.
*   Minor correction to OrderToCash: Use CDC dataset as source for VBRP

### Known issues
*   Analytics hub is [currently only supported in the EU and US regions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-introduction). If deploying the Weather DAG in a specific location where the source linked datasets are not available, you may need to resort to another source for weather data or create a scheduled query to feed a copy in the same location, and use a transfer service to copy the records into a table in the desired location.


## May 2022 - Release 2.1.1 (minor update)

*   Fixed AddressesMD date format to '9999-12-31'
*   Merged original 800 and 200 demo client tables into test harness for ECC (now it has both 800 and 100). This client was mostly used for demos.
*   Commenting out deployment of Product Recommender ML model as it requires specific reservations and a sample dataset that is only offered in the US region.
*   Addressing [issue #4](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cortex-data-foundation/issues/4) (Thanks, Ludovic Dessemon!)
*   Ignoring .INCLUDE when generating DAGs and Runtime views
*   Fixed RUNTIME view logic generation affecting keys with deletion
*   Thanks to Andres Mora Achurra from Camanchaca for the feedback :)

## March 2022 - Release 2.1

### Data Foundation

This release brings the following changes Cortex Data Foundation.

**Features & Improvements:**

* Templatized deployment and SQL Flavour for views, `setting.yaml `file and test harness to deploy either ECC or S4:
    1. New split source of data with `MANDT = 050` for ECC and `MANDT = 100` for S/4. These will populate automatically based on the `_SQL_FLAVOUR` parameter in the build (default to 'ECC')
    2. Original dataset from ECC and S/4 mixed still present in the source bucket (`MANDT = 800`)
    3. Views `FixedAssets`, `SDStatus_Items`, `GLDocumentsHdr`, `BSID` and `BSAD` implementations, `InvoiceDocuments_flow`,`DeliveriesStatus_PerSalesOrg`, `SalesFulfillment_perOrder`, `SalesFulfillment`, `UoMUsage_SAMPLE` will be adapted to S/4 with source tables in a next minor release.
* Additional views for ECC and S/4 with Accounts Receivables and On-Time/In-Full analysis:
    -  Billing
    - OrderToCash
    - AccountingDocumentsReceivables
* Additional helper functions for currency conversion
* Additional function for Due Date calculation for discounts
* New helper function for Fiscal period
* Renamed CDC parameters to match Reporting and ML Models.
* SAP Reporting now has a SQL Flavour switch to correctly deploy S4 or ECC based on the `_SQL_FLAVOUR` parameter. Possible valus are `ECC` or `S4`
* Enhanced reporting and calculation logics in:
    - `Deliveries`
    - `PurchaseDocuments`
    - `SalesOrders`
* Reduced CDC deployment copy step by 80% implementing multithreaded copy.
* Optimized overall build time when Cloud Build has the container cached, improving overall deployment time by 50%


**Bug Fixes:**
* Fix for Runtime views not generated from `setting.yaml`
* Deployment dependencies causing errors on view creation


**Known issues:**
-   Hierarchy flattener not configured to find sets in new test data
-   `.INCLUDE` in some tables in some versions of S/4 is known to be marked as key, which results in invalid SQLs in DAG generation. Recommendation as of now is to clear the _keyflag_ field in the offending `.INCLUDE` entry in the replicated `DD03L` table in BigQuery when generating the DAG. A better solution will be provided in a future release.
